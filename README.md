# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms project, which is a part of the 0x1B curriculum. This project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and play a critical role in organizing data efficiently. This project aims to teach you about different sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and algorithm complexity.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Understand the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Learn how to choose the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Understand what constitutes a stable sorting algorithm.

## Requirements

- Code should be written in C.
- Use the provided header files and functions for printing arrays and lists.
- Follow the specified style guide (Betty style) for code formatting.
- Do not use global variables.
- Limit each source file to no more than five functions.
- Avoid using standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`, etc.), unless allowed.
- Provide prototypes of all functions in the `sort.h` header file.
- Include include guards in header files.
- A list or array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
- Ensure your code compiles on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific compiler options.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following tasks:

### 0. Bubble Sort

- Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.
- Print the array after each swap operation.
- Provide Big O notations for the best case, average case, and worst case in the `0-O` file.

### 1. Insertion Sort

- Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm for sorting a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order.
- Print the list after each swap operation.
- Provide Big O notations for the best case, average case, and worst case in the `1-O` file.

### 2. Selection Sort

- Implement the Selection Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.
- Print the array after each swap operation.
- Provide Big O notations for the best case, average case, and worst case in the `2-O` file.

### 3. Quick Sort

- Implement the Quick Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the Lomuto partition scheme.
- Print the array after each swap operation.
- Provide Big O notations for the best case, average case, and worst case in the `3-O` file.

## Usage

You can test each sorting algorithm by following the examples provided in the respective `main.c` files. Use the provided Makefile or compile your code manually with the required compiler options.

## GitHub Repository

Please ensure that your project is hosted on GitHub, and there should be one project repository per group. Do not clone or fork the project repository with the same name before the second deadline to avoid scoring issues.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Respect copyright and plagiarism rules. Do not copy or publish someone else's work. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
